In the world of web design and development, a minimalist approach has gained a lot of popularity in recent years.
Minimalist design focuses on creating an aesthetic that is clean, uncluttered, and simple. This design philosophy is all
about making the most of the essentials and doing away with the superfluous. Quasar Minimalist Design, an admin
template, is a perfect example of this philosophy.

Quasar Minimalist Design is a premium admin template that offers a range of features and functionalities. It is designed
to cater to the needs of businesses and organisations that require a user-friendly and efficient dashboard. The template
includes a range of components, including a dashboard, customers, library, settings, calendar, and login page.
